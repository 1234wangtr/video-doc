    /**
     * Codec delay.
     *
     * Video:
     *   Number of frames the decoded output will be delayed relative to the
     *   encoded input.
     *
     * Audio:
     *   For encoding, this is the number of "priming"[美]['praɪmɪŋ]雷管 samples added by the
     *   encoder to the beginning of the stream. The decoded output will be
     *   delayed by this many samples relative to the input to the encoder (or
     *   more, if the decoder adds its own padding).
     *   The timestamps on the output packets are adjusted by the encoder so
     *   that they always refer to the first sample of the data actually
     *   contained in the packet, including any added padding.
     *   E.g. if the timebase is 1/samplerate and the timestamp of the first
     *   input sample is 0, the timestamp of the first output packet will be
     *   -delay.
     *
     *   For decoding, this is the number of samples the decoder needs to
     *   output before the decoder's output is valid. When seeking, you should
     *   start decoding this many samples prior to your desired seek point.
     *
     * - encoding: Set by libavcodec.
     * - decoding: Set by libavcodec.

aac 编码器，在初始化时设置了这个值
static av_cold int aac_encode_init(AVCodecContext *avctx)
