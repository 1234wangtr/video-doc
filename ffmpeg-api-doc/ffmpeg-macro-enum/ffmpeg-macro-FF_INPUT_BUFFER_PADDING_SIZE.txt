FF_INPUT_BUFFER_PADDING_SIZE 附加的缓存大小

libavcodec/avcodec.h

/**
 * @ingroup lavc_decoding
 * Required number of additionally allocated bytes at the end of the input bitstream for decoding.
 * This is mainly needed because some optimized bitstream readers read
 * 32 or 64 bit at once and could read over the end.<br>
 * Note: If the first 23 bits of the additional bytes are not 0, then damaged
 * MPEG bitstreams could cause overread and segfault.
