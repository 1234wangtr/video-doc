 * @param[in] avpkt The input AVpacket containing the input buffer.
 *            You can create such packet with av_init_packet() and by then setting
 *            data and size, some decoders might in addition need other fields like
 *            flags&AV_PKT_FLAG_KEY. All decoders are designed to use the least
 *            fields possible.
 
 * Decode the video frame of size avpkt->size from avpkt->data into picture.
 * Some decoders may support multiple frames in a single AVPacket, such
 * decoders would then just decode the first frame.
 *
 * @warning The input buffer must be FF_INPUT_BUFFER_PADDING_SIZE larger than
 * the actual read bytes because some optimized bitstream readers read 32 or 64
 * bits at once and could read over the end.
 *
 * @warning The end of the input buffer buf should be set to 0 to ensure that
 * no overreading happens for damaged MPEG streams.
 *
 * @note Codecs which have the CODEC_CAP_DELAY capability set have a delay
 * between input and output, these need to be fed with avpkt->data=NULL,
 * avpkt->size=0 at the end to return the remaining frames.
