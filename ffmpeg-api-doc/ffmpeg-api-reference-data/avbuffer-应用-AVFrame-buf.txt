    /**
     * AVBuffer references backing the data for this frame. If all elements of
     * this array are NULL, then this frame is not reference counted.
     *
     * There may be at most one AVBuffer per data plane, so for video this array
     * always contains all the references. For planar audio with more than
     * AV_NUM_DATA_POINTERS channels, there may be more buffers than can fit in
     * this array. Then the extra AVBufferRef pointers are stored in the
     * extended_buf array.
