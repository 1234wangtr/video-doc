How is qcomp exactly affecting bitrate and quantizer?

Quantizer curve compression, or “qcomp”, is a very old and simple idea.
Lower the quality in areas of the video with high complexity and raise the quality in areas with low complexity. 
The original implementation dates at least back to the original libavcodec ratecontrol.
