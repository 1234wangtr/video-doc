An Edit Box maps the presentation time-line to the media time-line as it is stored in the file. 
The Edit Box is a container for the edit lists. 
The Edit Box is optional. 
In the absence of this box, there is an implicit one-to-one mapping of these time-lines, and 
the presentation of a track starts at the beginning of the presentation. 
An empty edit is used to offset the start time of a track.
