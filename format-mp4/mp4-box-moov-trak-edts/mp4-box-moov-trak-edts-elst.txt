static int mov_read_elst(MOVContext *c, AVIOContext *pb, MOVAtom atom)
MOVStreamContext::time_offset 字段

Box Type:  ‘elst’ 
Container:  Edit Box (‘edts’) 
Mandatory: No 
Quantity:  Zero or one 

This box contains an explicit timeline map. 
Each entry defines part of the track time-line: 
by mapping part of the media time-line, or by indicating ‘empty’ time, or by defining a ‘dwell’, 
where a single time-point in the media is held for a period.

Note that edits are not restricted to fall on sample times. 
This means that when entering an edit, 
it can be necessary to (a) back up to a sync point, and pre-roll from there and then (b) be careful about the duration of the first sample — 
it might have been truncated if the edit enters it during its normal duration.  
If this is audio, that frame might need to be decoded, and then the final slicing done.  
Likewise, the duration of the last sample in an edit might need slicing. 
Starting offsets for tracks (streams) are represented by an initial empty edit. 
For example, to play a track from its start for 30 seconds, 
but at 10 seconds into the presentation, 
we have the following edit list: 

Entry-count = 2 
 
Segment-duration = 10 seconds 
Media-Time = -1 
Media-Rate = 1

Segment-duration = 30 seconds (could be the length of the whole track) 
Media-Time = 0 seconds 
Media-Rate = 1

aligned(8) class EditListBox extends FullBox(‘elst’, version, 0) { 
 unsigned int(32) entry_count; 
  for (i=1; i <= entry_count; i++) { 
  if (version==1) { 
   unsigned int(64) segment_duration; 
   int(64) media_time; 
    } else { // version==0 
   unsigned int(32) segment_duration; 
   int(32) media_time; 
  } 
  int(16) media_rate_integer; 
    int(16) media_rate_fraction = 0; 
 } 
}

version is an integer that specifies the version of this box (0 or 1) 

entry_count is an integer that gives the number of entries in the following table 

segment_duration is an integer that specifies the duration of this edit segment in units of the timescale in the Movie Header Box 

media_time is an integer containing the starting time within the media of this edit segment (in media time scale units, in composition time). 
If this field is set to –1, it is an empty edit. The last edit in a track shall never be an empty edit. 
Any difference between the duration in the Movie Header Box, and 
the track’s duration is expressed as an implicit empty edit at the end. 

media_rate specifies the relative rate at which to play the media corresponding to this edit segment. 
If this value is 0, then the edit is specifying a ‘dwell’: the media at media-time is presented for the segment-duration.  
Otherwise this field shall contain the value 1.
