This site is the registration authority for code-points in "MP4 Family" files. 
Within the documentation on this site are code-points from specifications both using and related to the ISO specifications for which this is the formal registry.

The registered code-points include four-character codes (4CCs) used in various ways within these file formats, and 
ObjectTypeIndication values used in MPEG-4 systems. 
The four-character codes are divided into various categories, for convenience. 
The largest category is the box (atom) types. 
The only box (atom) types which are not normally registered are boxes that are within the sample entry (sample description) for, and specific to, 
a codec or family of codecs, or 
that are used in a specific coding system (e.g. boxes used in a specific hint track).
