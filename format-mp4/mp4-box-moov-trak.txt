Track Identifiers 

The track identifiers used in an ISO file are unique within that file; no two tracks shall use the same identifier. 

The next track identifier value stored in next_track_ID in the Movie Header Box 
generally contains a value one greater than the largest track identifier value found in the file. 

This enables easy generation of a track identifier under most circumstances. 
However, if this value is equal to ones (32-bit unsigned maxint), then a search for an unused track identifier is needed for all additions.
