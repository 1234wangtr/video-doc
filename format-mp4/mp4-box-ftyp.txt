File Type Box[edit]

In order to identify the specifications to which a file based on ISO base media file format complies,
遵从，依从，服从( comply的第三人称单数 )
comply[英][kəmˈplaɪ] [美][kəmˈplaɪ] vi.遵从；依从，顺从；应允，同意
brands[美][brænd]品牌 are used as identifiers in the file format. 

MP4 文件开始位置必须是一个 ftyp-box
They are set in a box named File Type Box ('ftyp'), which must be placed in the beginning of the file.

It is somewhat analogous[美][əˈnæləɡəs]相似的 to the so-called fourcc code, 
used for a similar purpose for media embedded in AVI container format.[46]

A brand might indicate the type of encoding used, 
how the data of each encoding is stored, 
constraints[美][kənˈstrent]强制 and extensions that are applied to the file, the compatibility, or the intended usage of the file. 

Brands are a printable four-character codes. 

A File Type Box contains two kinds of brands.
 
One is "major_brand" which identifies the specification of the best use for the file. 
It is followed by "minor_version", an informative 4 bytes integer for the minor version of the major brand. 

The second kind of brand is "compatible_brands", which identifies multiple specifications to which the file complies. 

All files shall contain a File Type Box, 
but for compatibility reasons with an earlier version of the specification, 
files may be conformant to ISO base media file format and not contain a File Type Box. 

In that case they should be read as if they contained an ftyp with major and compatible brand "mp41" (MP4 v1 - ISO 14496-1, Chapter 13).[1] 
Many in-use brands (ftyps) are not registered and can be found on some webpages.[23]

A multimedia file structured upon ISO base media file format may be compatible with more than one concrete specification, and 
it is therefore not always possible to speak of a single "type" or "brand" for the file. 
In this regard, the utility of the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension type and file name extension is somewhat reduced. 
In spite of that, when a derived specification is written, a new file extension will be used, a new MIME type and a new Macintosh file type.
