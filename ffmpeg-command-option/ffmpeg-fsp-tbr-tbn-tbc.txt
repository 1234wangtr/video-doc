分别代表什么意思？

There are three different time bases for time stamps in FFmpeg. 
The values printed are actually reciprocals of these, i.e. 1/tbr, 1/tbn and 1/tbc.

tbn = the time base in AVStream that has come from the container
tbc = the time base in AVCodecContext for the codec used for a particular stream
tbr = tbr is guessed from the video stream and is the value users want to see when they look for the video frame rate
