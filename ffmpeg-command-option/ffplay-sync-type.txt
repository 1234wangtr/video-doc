以何种方式同步

-sync type
Set the master clock to audio (type=audio), video (type=video) or external (type=ext). 
Default is audio. The master clock is used to control audio-video synchronization. 
Most media players use audio as master clock, but in some cases (streaming or high quality broadcast) it is necessary to change that. 
This option is mainly used for debugging purposes.
