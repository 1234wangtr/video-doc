WebRTC enables all kinds of real time communication 
such as audio, video and text between users 
by utilising the browsers. 
Using WebRTC bears different benefits for different market segments. 

For end users it has two major advantages:

1）Ease of use: Real-time communication is supported 
without the need for additional applications or plug-ins.

2）Security: WebRTC enforces the usage of encryption 
for both the media and the signalling. 
Thereby, WebRTC provides a higher security level 
than most currently available commercial telephony systems.

For enterprises WebRTC can provide even more benefits：

1）Cost savings: Save on the costs 
of toll-free telephone number for call centres

2）Rich communication: 
Enhance the communication to users and between employers 
with video and messaging 
without the need for special applications and servers.

3）Un-interrupted communication: 
Keep the customers on the web page and 
at the same time start a voice and video call with customer.

4）Security: Secure the communication 
with the customers 
as well as employees in the home office and remote branches 
using state of the art encryption standards.

For operators, WebRTC can additionally provide new opportunities:

1）Mobile Telephony: 
By relying on WebRTC technology, 
service providers can enable users to access their VoIP service 
while on the go without specialised applications.

2）Hosted Services: 
By deploying a WebRTC gateway end users 
would be able to access the SIP based hosted PBX and call centers 
without the need to change these services.

3）WebRTC as a Service: 
Similar to hosted PBX services, 
service providers can host WebRTC Gateways on behalf of enterprises. 
WebRTC calls destined to the enterprise 
are handled by a WebRTC Gateway of the service provider. 
Incoming WebRTC calls would 
be translated into SIP calls and routed to the enterprise. 
The enterprise would not have to change anything in its infrastructure,
as it will still be only handling SIP calls
