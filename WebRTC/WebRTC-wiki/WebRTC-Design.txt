Major components of WebRTC include:

1）getUserMedia, which allows a web browser to 
access the camera and microphone and to capture media
2）RTCPeerConnection, which sets up audio/video calls
3）RTCDataChannel, which allow browsers to share data via peer-to-peer

The WebRTC API also includes a statistics function:

4）getStats, which allows the web application to 
retrieve a set of statistics about WebRTC sessions. 
These statistics data are being described in a separate W3C document.

As of November 2015, 
the IETF WebRTC Audio Codec and Processing Requirements draft 
requires implementations to 

1）provide PCMA/PCMU (RFC 3551), 
RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
PCMA(G.711A)  PCMU(G.711U)

2）Telephone Event as DTMF (RFC 4733), and 
双音多频信号（Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency, DTMF），
电话系统中电话机与交换机之间的一种用户信令，通常用于发送被叫号码

3）Opus (RFC 6716) audio codecs as minimum capabilities. 
The PeerConnection, data channel and media capture browser APIs 
are detailed in the W3C.

W3C is developing ORTC (Object Real-time Communications) for WebRTC.
This is commonly referred to as WebRTC 1.1.
