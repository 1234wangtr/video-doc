In January 2015, TorrentFreak reported that 
browsers supporting WebRTC suffer from a serious security flaw 
that compromises the security of VPN-tunnels, 
by allowing the true IP address of the user to be read.[26] 
The IP address read requests 
are not visible in the browser's developer console, and 
they are not blocked by common ad blocking/privacy plugins 
(enabling online tracking by advertisers and other entities despite precautions).[27]

WebRTC can be enabled and disabled in Firefox 
by toggling the value of "media.peerconnection.enabled" in about:config, and 
WebRTC settings can be changed in about:webrtc. 
WebRTC cannot be disabled in the desktop version of Google Chrome, 
although there is a plug-in available for blocking it
