JsSIP is a simple to use library for the programming language JavaScript which takes advantage of latest developments in SIP and WebRTC to provide a fully featured SIP endpoint in any website. With JsSIP any website can get real-time communication features using audio, video and more with just a few lines of code. Using JsSIP it is possible to build SIP user agents that can send and receive audio and video calls, and text messages.

JsSIP uses the SIP over WebSocket transport for sending an receiving SIP requests and responses, and thus, it requires a SIP proxy/server with WebSocket support. Currently the following SIP servers have been tested and are using JsSIP as the basis for their WebRTC Gateway functionality:

FRAFOS ABC WebRTC Gateway
OverSIP
Kamailio
Asterisk
reSIProcate and repro

WebRTC web browsers[edit]

At media plane (audio calls), JsSIP version 0.2.0 works with Chrome browser from version 24. 
At signaling plane (SIP protocol), JsSIP runs in any WebSocket capable browser
