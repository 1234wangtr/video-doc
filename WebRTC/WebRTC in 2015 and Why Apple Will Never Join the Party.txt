WebRTC has gone on to become the open source standard for Google, 
but there is still no word from Apple about its support, 
and I am going to be bold here and say it will never happen.

The reason for that is in the latest iOS 8 and OS X updates, Apple took its own approach to voice calling by adding a feature to hand over calls between your Apple devices using FaceTime and iMessage. I donâ€™t believe Apple cares about WebRTC given the time and effort it has put into creating a seamless experience with Apple products in its usual walled garden.
