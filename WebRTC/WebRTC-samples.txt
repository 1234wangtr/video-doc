WebRTC code samples

This is a repository for the WebRTC Javascript code samples.

Some of the samples use new browser features. They may only work in Chrome Canary and/or Firefox Beta, and may require flags to be set.

All of the samples use adapter.js, a shim to insulate apps from spec changes and prefix differences. In fact, the standards and protocols used for WebRTC implementations are highly stable, and there are only a few prefixed names. For full interop information, see webrtc.org/web-apis/interop.

In Chrome and Opera, all samples that use getUserMedia() must be run from a server. Calling getUserMedia() from a file:// URL will work in Firefox, but fail silently in Chrome and Opera.

webrtc.org/testing lists command line flags useful for development and testing with Chrome.

For more information about WebRTC, we maintain a list of WebRTC Resources. If you’ve never worked with WebRTC, we recommend you start with the 2013 Google I/O WebRTC presentation.
