MPEG-1 Audio is divided into 3 layers.

MPEG-1 Layer I is nothing more than a simplified version of Layer II.[12] Layer I uses a smaller 384-sample frame size for very low delay, and finer resolution.
Layer I uses a smaller 384-sample frame size for very low delay, and finer resolution.

MPEG-1 Layer II (MP2—often incorrectly called MUSICAM)[48] is a lossy audio format designed to provide high quality at about 192 kbit/s for stereo sound. Decoding MP2 audio is computationally simple, relative to MP3, AAC, etc
The size of a Layer II frame is fixed at 1152-samples (coefficients[英][kəʊɪ'fɪʃənts] [美][koʊɪ'fɪʃənts] 系数).

MPEG-1 Layer III (MP3) is a lossy audio format designed to provide acceptable quality at about 64 kbit/s for monaural audio over single-channel (BRI) ISDN links, and 128 kbit/s for stereo sound.
MP3 works on 1152 samples like Layer II, but needs to take multiple frames for analysis before frequency-domain (MDCT) processing and quantization can be effective.

MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III,[4] more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression.
