AAC is a variable bitrate (VBR) block-based codec where each block decodes to 1024 time-domain samples.
Allegedly[英][ə'ledʒɪdlɪ] [美][ə'ledʒɪdlɪ]据称, each frame stands alone and does not depend on previous frames 
(whereas many perceptual audio codecs overlap data with the previous frame)

frame length flag:
0: Each packet contains 1024 samples
1: Each packet contains 960 samples

In an MPEG-4 file, the AAC data is broken up into a series of variable length frames
