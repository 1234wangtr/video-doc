The WAV file is an instance of a Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) defined by IBM and Microsoft
RIFF chunks - Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) 是分块存储的 块头+数据

struct wavfile
{
    char        id[4];          // should always contain "RIFF"
    int     totallength;    // total file length minus 8
    char        wavefmt[8];     // should be "WAVEfmt "
    int     format;         // 16 for PCM format
    short     pcm;            // 1 for PCM format
    short     channels;       // channels
    int     frequency;      // sampling frequency
    int     bytes_per_second;
    short     bytes_by_capture;
    short     bits_per_sample;
    char        data[4];        // should always contain "data"
    int     bytes_in_data;
};

注意：双声道的数据存储格式为，打包形式
Multi-channel digital audio samples are stored as interlaced wave data 
which simply means that the audio samples of a multi-channel (such as stereo and surround) wave file are stored by 
cycling through the audio samples for each channel before advancing to the next sample time.
