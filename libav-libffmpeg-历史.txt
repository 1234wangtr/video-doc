Why Debian returned to FFmpeg

MPlayer and FFmpeg projects are originally two very close communities; 
both projects started around the same time (year 2000), 
and still share a lot of commons things 
(MPlayer uses FFmpeg API, a lot of developers were working on both projects, 
they were hosted on the same server, and more)
