debug 相关的选项

Developer options (useful when working on Libav itself):

  --disable-debug          disable debugging symbols

  --enable-debug=LEVEL     set the debug level [$debuglevel]
sets the debugging level for the compilation command, 
that is it will add to it the flag: -g LEVEL. 

The meaning of that flag partly depends on the compiler used, for 
example check the man page for gcc if you're using that. 

Also if you want to debug ffmpeg the tool, it's better to use ffmpeg_g 
which contains all the debugging symbols which are stripped away from 
ffmpeg (the same is valid for the other tools as well).
